If you are new at programming, your first step is know how to print a message on screen, the traditional "Hello World".

How to:
-------------

Let's create a new project;

> Start your Visual Studio;

> Select: File, New Project;

> Console Application is selected by default, keep it;

> Our first program will be called "Hello World". Ok;

> The new project appears in the Solution Exeplorer;

Your project is created. Now it's time to code!

In our Main let's write:

> Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
>
>// Keep the console window open in debug mode.
>         Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit.");
>         Console.ReadKey();

Console.WriteLine() print our message and Console.ReadKey() keep the console until any key is pressed by the user. 

In C# we always finish our lines with ";"!
In C# we comment our codes with "//"!
